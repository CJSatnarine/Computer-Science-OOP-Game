OOP assignment for Computer Science class. 

* Movement:
- W moves up. 
- S moves down. 
- A moves left. 
- D moves right. 
- Spacebar shoots projectiles. 

* Sprites:
- Blue enemies exist in the code, but will do nothing in the game. I plan to remove them because they seem useless.  
- Red enemies follow the player and do nothing (for now).
- Projectiles push the enemies away.
- The player is, well, the player.

I submitted the assignment on January 31, 2023. I will continue to work on this project.
