OOP assignment for Computer Science class. 

W is to move towards mouse position. 
S is to move away from mouse position. 
A is supposed to move left. 
D is supposed to move right. 
Spacebar is supposed to shoot projectiles. 

NOTE: the left and right movements are not implimented properly. 

Blue enemies do nothing (for now).
Red enemies follows the player and do nothing (for now).
Projectiles just exists when the spacebar is pressed (for now).

Basically everything is a mess. üëç
