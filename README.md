OOP assignment for Computer Science class. 

- W moves up. 
- S moves down. 
- A moves left. 
- D moves right. 
- Spacebar shoots projectiles. 

NOTE: the left and right movements are not implimented properly. 

- Blue enemies exist in the code, but will do nothing in the game. I plan to remove them because they seem useless.  
- Red enemies follows the player and do nothing (for now).
- Projectiles push the enemies away.

I submitted the assignment on January 31, 2023. I will continue to work on this project.
