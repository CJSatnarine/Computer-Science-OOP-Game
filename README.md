This project was an assignment to prove my understanding of Object Oriented Programming for Computer Science class. The assignment was submitted on the 31st of January, 2023. 

I have no plan on what this game is, I was just adding random things as I coded along. 

# Movement:
- W moves up. 
- S moves down. 
- A moves left. 
- D moves right. 
- Spacebar shoots projectiles. 

# Sprites:
- Blue enemies exist in the code, but will do nothing in the game. I would probably remove them eventually because they seem useless.  
- Red enemies follow the player and do nothing for now.
- Projectiles push the enemies away.
- The player is, well, the player.
